    <h1>Mimics and other Oozes</h1>
    <h2>What is an Ooze?</h2>
    <p>Oozes are monsters who have amorphous or otherwise extremely malleable forms. Scholars have noted that oozes are best classified as creatures whose body is (or can be) upward of 90% liquid, and whose chemical composition is either extremely acidic or extremely basic. Frequently this is achieved by having an object with an arcane field that functions as the "core", though in more advanced cases the body itself generates its own field which regulates all the relevant functions and holds the ooze together.</p>

        <h2>The Mimic</h2>
        <p>By far the most complex of the Oozes, mimics come in many shapes and sizes. While they have a reputation as ravenous ambush hunters, this is only partially true. Many people know the Chest Mimic, which disguises itself as a treasure chest to lure in unwary adventurers and plunderers. However, one might not know that this is only one of the forms a Mimic can take.</p>
        <h3>Diet and hunting habits</h3>
        <p>Mimics are omnivorous, and extremely efficient ambush hunters. As members of the ooze family, they are capable of digesting almost all organic materials they come in contact with, though a lower bodily acidity and a heightened capacity for hardening their bodies means they generally prefer to chew large portions.</p>
        <p>However, all of this is a primarily instinctive drive. In their natural environment, mimics are often driven to ravenous, almost compulsive eating habits due to an inability to guarantee how long it will be until their next meal. It is possible for a skilled handler of animals to train a mimic by feeding it regularly, though it is important to note that missing a meal can be devastating to a mimic's trust.</p>
        <p>It is for this reason that many experienced adventurers keep spare rations, generally preparing as if they were traveling with up to three extra people. (And for at least a few days longer than they expect to be out of town.) This is because, in many cases, it is simply easier to feed a mimic than it is to fight it.</p>
        <h3>Forms and non-hunting behaviours</h3>
        <p>Most adventurers will be familiar with the Chest Mimic, the most successful hunting form adopted by the mimic species.</p>
        <p>However some wary scholars may have heard tell of the book mimic, while sailors may be more familiar with tales of mimics in the forms of Ropes or Hawsers. Barkeeps may have even had to deal with a Barrel mimic, perhaps the boldest of mimic forms.</p>
        <p>In fact, mimics can theoretically change forms at will depending on the area in which they hunt. However, they do tend to develop a preferred form as they age, and can sometimes find themselves quite out-of-place if they are displaced from their usual hunting grounds. If you see a big chest in the middle of a forest, you might just be dealing with a displaced mimic.</p>
        <p>While hunting takes up the majority of a mimic's time, specimens who have learned to be humanoid-dependant often display a strange form of playful behaviour. They will assume the shape of appropriately-sized objects that their humanoids interact with regularly, waiting for their humanoid to look closer before growing teeth and eyes to scare them. As a rule, these pranks are harmless, but it is worth repeating that a mimic that hasn't been fed in a while can and will take a thumb as recompense for the slight.</p>
        <p>In rare cases, skilled mimic keepers have reported being able to train their mimics to take on specific shapes at will, though they will shy away from forms such as weapons or armour, and a mimic in the shape of a container will occasionally choose not to return items it has been entrusted with.</p>

        <h2>Gelatinous Cubes</h2>
        <p>Gelatinous cubes are a subset of ooze who have adapted seemingly to prey on creatures with darkvision. Namely, they are transparent and grey, meaning creatures relying exclisively on their ability to see in the dark, and therefore seeing only in shades of grey, often have a much harder time detecting them.</p>
        <p>While they lack any true intelligence and have yet to display any trainability, it is known that a gelatinous cube is drawn to heat and the smell of food. They can easily be led to more fitting or even useful environments simply by laying a trail of food. In this way they have historically been kept as an effective form of pest control, though proper habitat and enrichment is vital to such a setup.</p>

    <h2>Puddings</h2>
    <p>Puddings are the most common form of Ooze that the average person will meet. They are generally simple creatures that melt into the cracks between stones in order to appear as if from nowhere. However it has been determined that while they share the Gelatinous Cube's ability to sense heat, they react in the opposite manner; that is, high temperatures can cause an Ooze to flee or reactively recoil from otherwise easy prey.</p><p>It has been theorised that the different colours of pudding are either different genus of the same species, or as is more commonly believed, that a pudding changes colour as it ages.</p>

    <h2>Oblexi</h2>
    <p>By order of the crown we are required to inform you of a newly discovered and particularly heinous form of Ooze; the Oblex.</p>
    <p>Oblexi are reported to be psychic oozes who are able to mimic the minds and bodies of its captured prey, and some report oblexi mimicking forms of loved ones from stolen memories of victims-to-be. While not much is yet known about this creature, it is believed to have access to powerful enchantment magic and illusion magic. When adventuring, always be wary for strands of red slime that may indicate that the person you're speaking to is actually an Oblex.</p>
