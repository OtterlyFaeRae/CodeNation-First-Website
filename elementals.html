    <h1>Elementals</h1>
    <h2>What are elementals?</h2>
    <p>Elementals are living aspects of the natural world. Generally, they are what happens when an elementally-aligned spirit finds a suitable object or substance to inhabit. There are instances of magic practicioners creating vessels specifically for an elemental spirit to inhabit, though this usually involves some kind of binding and will rarely result in a wild or free-roaming creature. Most of the elementals you will encounter are simply the result of untainted land, pure and wild and untouched by artifice or pollution.</p>

        <h2>Mephits</h2>
        <p>The most common form of elemental. Mephits are often likened to imps, but that does them an injustice. Mephits are small, but adaptable spirits who often fashion their bodies out of materials rather than full objects. Ice mephits from ice, steam mephits from steam, dust mephits from dust, etcetera.</p>
        <p>A mephit's personality is often dramatically affected by the element they are best attuned to. Most of the advice on elementals of specific elements also applies to mephits of the same element. There is one overarching piece of advice for mephits, however: they love sweets. Natural sugars such as fruits and honey make for excellent offerings to invite the help or attention of a mephit.</p>

        <h2>Air Elementals</h2>
        <p>Air elementals arise from areas of pure, clean air. Typically their forms are changeable, as is to be expected from a mostly gasseous creature. They frequently travel great distances, never congregating in large numbers except in response to the formation of storms and hurricanes. If you find yourself buffeted by sudden, unseasonal winds, you've likely found yourself in the tailwind of an Air elemental.</p>
        <p>The more volatile air elementals take the form of whirling gales and thundering storms, while more stable forms might include clouds or steam. They enjoy offerings of incense and the sound of music. If ever you wish to attract an Air elemental, these elements would be vital to any ritual you would perform to this end. In the majority of cases though, these are aspects of folk tales on how to calm unruly winds. In fact, this plays a large part in why Sea Shanties are so important aboard ships; to invite the winds themselves to favour the crew.</p>

        <h2>Earth Elementals</h2>
        <p>Forming from untouched mineral deposits, Earth Elementals are often sought after for the rare and precious minerals they frequently incorporate into their forms. However, this is usually a fool's errand; Earth elementals are both highly communal, and extremely territorial. It is for this reason that one should always take at least one practiced druid when prospecting for new mining claims or fertile farmland.</p>
        <p>If this is not possible or practical, the alternative is to leave offerings of minerals that enrich soil and earth in any of their forms. The most common offering is compost, though offerings of charcoal are not uncommon. Those who can afford to have offered various useful metals, with varying results.</p>
        <p>Typically, Earth elementals are sedentary creatures; they do not roam far from their claims. This likely plays an important role in their avid territorialism. Respect their land above all else, and whatever you do, do not try to take from land kept by these entities without their express permission.</p>

        <h2>Water Elementals</h2>
        <p>Arising from natural springs and rivers untouched by humankind, water elementals can be both the kindest of the elementals and the most terrible when slighted. It is common practice among druids to ask the elements for permission before drawing water from such places, and to never bathe in water from these sacred springs.</p>
        <p>Water elementals frequently find themselves in direct competition with their fire-aspected cousins, and such conflicts can be explosive and dangerous. It is worth remembering, though, that they are also perfectly natural events. Usually the two entities will "cancel" each other out and either return to a status quo, or expend their physical forms in the conflict and return to the spirits from which they came. Many belief systems place Water as important in matters of spirit in general, and so many such systems place great value on Water Elementals and their role in maintaining their ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Those who respect the homes of these elementals often find themselves fortuitously drawn to water when lost in the forest, which any survivalist will tell you is a significant boon.</p>

        <h2>Fire Elementals</h2>
        <p>Depending what academic circles you walk in, you may have heard the term "By Fire Be Purged," particularly if the circle is that of Evocation Wizards. This is a good, albeit basic, primer for looking into Fire Elementals. They arise most readily in volcanic regions, but can form spontaneously during wildfire season. The shortest lived of all elementals, wildfire elementals are often seen as a purely destructive force.</p>
        <p>However, this is not always the case. Volcanic elementals have been known to divert pyroclastic flows for the protection or even enrichment of the land, and it's been noted that wildfires that spawn fire elementals also tend to produce extremely fertile soil from the ash left behind, sometimes producing rare and beautiful flower blooms come next spring. In fact, some flowers bloom exclusively in these conditions.</p>
        <p>Moreover, fire elementals are some of the only elementals that will form in response to corruption, specifically when a corrupted site begins to burn. When tended by these elementals, such fires can purify otherwise unsalvageable areas, allowing other forces of nature to reclaim them.</p>
        <p>While human interaction is not recommended without specialist training, paying respect to them by lighting candles or campfires on important solstice dates is generally good practice for those in the elemental studies.</p>
