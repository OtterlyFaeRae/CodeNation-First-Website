    <p>Welcome to the TFSEMM! Here, our experts compile information on the subject of monsters.</p>

    <h2>About us</h2>
    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>We are the Terra Fantasia Society for Education on Misunderstood Monsters.</p>
    <h3>What do we do?</h3>
    <p>We help to combat misinformation regarding some of the monsters in our world that have a bad rap. Mimics, elementals, even some forms of undead see mistreatment at the hands of adventurers and guards who don't understand them. Yet more creatures are truly dangerous, but aren't recognised as such at face value. We consider it our academic duty to solve both of these problems by making information on monsters publically available!</p>
    <h3>What exactly is a monster?</h3>
    <p>A monster is defined as a creature that does not naturally occur without the intervention of arcane forces, or which relies upon arcane forces to survive, hunt, or perform the other biological functions with which we define life. We understand that this definition is broad and confusing, which is why we exist!</p>

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <h3>When would this be useful?</h3>
        <p>Are you an adventurer uncertain what to do with that gnoll cub you just found? Did you find a mimic who doesn't seem hostile and you're not sure if it's still dangerous? Are you unsure whether that beast you slew last week was really a man-eating monster or just a displaced bear with mange? Or perhaps you're a town guard captain trying to figure out how best to manage a sudden influx of Sylphs in your neighbourhood. If any of these sound familiar, you've come to the right place!</p>
        <p>(Please note: All information is subject to change as this project is still in its early stages. Not all creatures mentioned above currently have pages on this website. If you actually have any of the issues above that aren't covered by our existing pages, please contact us directly or, if necessary, meet with your local adventurer's guild branch.)</p>
        <h3>This information conflicts with mine! What gives?</h3>
        <p>We here at the TFSEMM recognise that there are many factors that may render information unreliable. The changing nature of magic can make it difficult to keep track of every mutation, strain and offshoot species of monster that exists. However, the main complicating factor is that of other worlds, also called "Settings."</p>
        <p>If you are a traveler from another world or setting, we encourage you to use our guides as a guideline to begin to understand how our monsters differ from yours! However, in all other cases, we encourage you to contact us using our communications orb, rune code ANSUZ - EIWAZ - FEHU - PERTH in the case that our information conflicts with the evidence of your eyes.</p>
        <h3>Other worlds?</h3>
        <p>Terra Fantasia is a homebrew fictional universe (or "setting,") used by the author of this website for the tabletop game dungeons and dragons. This website contains a few pieces of homebrew lore for creatures and how they might behave differently in Terra Fantasia over a setting such as Eberron or Faeruun. Feel free to use these bits in your home game if you like, or just enjoy the read.</p>
        <h3>W-what?</h3>
        <p>Don't worry about it.</p>
